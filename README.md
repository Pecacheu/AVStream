# A/V Network Stream
AVStream is a minimal, cross platform command-line utility to stream your Camera/Webcam and/or Mic over the network. It does so silently without causing a fuss or drawing attention.

I ain't responsible if you use this to spy on people, I just made it to use as a simple IP camera for security purposes. Note that if your PC has a webcam indicator light, that will turn on when the webcam mode is active.
